Name: Dyllon Dunton


2. d.i. (min=5499ns),(max=43851ns),(average=12482ns)
   d.ii. I would pick 50000ns. If the maximum time it takes in just this trial was 43851ns, I need to account for the fact that it may be larger next time

3. c.i.(min=5129ns),(max=36325609ns),(average=7117203ns)
   c.ii. The min did not change, bu the rest changed immensely. I would up my polling period to 10ms in this case 

4.b.i. (min=4982ns),(max=8389ns),(average=6635ns)
  b.ii. All three values for latency dropped significantly. 

5.b.i. (min=4749ns),(max=3746230ns),(average=82683ns) |  (min=3333ns),(max=9389ns),(average=4834ns)
  b.ii. It would bog down programs that potentially need low latency


7.a. Hard, because the driver could crash if this does not work properly
  b. Soft, because there aren't any real consequences to this not working properly
  c. firm, because the quality of the video playback would decrease with failure
